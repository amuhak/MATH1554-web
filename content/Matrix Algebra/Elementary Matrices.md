An elementary matrix, $E$, is one that differs by $I_n$ by one [[Row Operations|row operation]]
Note:
1. Every $E$ is invertible
2. Every $E$ is square

For example,
$\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\2&1&0\\0&0&1\end{bmatrix}$ is an elementary matrix as it differs from $I_3$ by one row operation ($R_2=R_2-2R_1$)

# What Do They Represent
Each elementary matrix represents a row operation.
