 - A **pivot** position in a matrix A is a location in A that corresponds to a leading 1 in the row reduced echelon form of A.
- A **pivot column** is a column of A that contains a pivot position.

## Gaussian Elimination
- Swap the first row with a lower one so the leftmost nonzero entry is in the first row.
- Scale the 1st row so that its leading entry is equal to 1.
- Use row replacement so all entries above and below this leading entry (if any) are equal to zero.
